# SoftLisp
A simple embeddable lisp interpreter written in C++. 
This is a for-study project.

## Features
Currently SoftLisp is under development.

## Getting Started
This project is being developed directly on Windows 10. I am trying to avoid platform dependent code, but since I am using
Visual Studio 2017 CE and running on Windows 10, and not yet testing it in other environments, some windows-isms might slip.

In order to compile the project, you need:
- a binary distribution of Boost (for Boost::Parameters) in C:\SDL\local\boost_1_64_0

## What are you currently working on?
Currently SoftLisp is under development.

## What is your future work?
- To Be Defined
